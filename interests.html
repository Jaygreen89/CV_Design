        In my teens I picked up a guitar and have learnt to play and compose my own
        music. Over the years I have then moved on to newer instruments to learn
        how to play these to the same standard as I play guitar. I currently play
        guitar, classical/acoustic, bass, baritone ukulele, banjo, mandolin,
        dulcimer, drums and a few percussion instruments. As a hobby of mine and a
        love for creating music, I am always looking for the next challenge and
        Instrument I can get a good sound out of.

        One of my other hobbies is traveling; I have recently been traveling to
        Asia and around Europe. It is a big part of my life to see as many things
        and as many places I can as I find nothing more exciting that to be
        immersed in other cultures and traditions, seeing what people do and how
        people live is a big interest to me as one day I would like to see the rest
        of the world. My challenge is to see as many countries as I am years old.
        So far, I haven’t reached 32 (A pandemic got in the way) but I’m only a few
        away now.
